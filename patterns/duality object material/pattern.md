- **Purpose**: Represents how objects and portions of matter are the same material entity, like a statue that is at the same time a portion of clay. 
- **Example Use Case**: The example describes an entity that is a material (steel, subsubclass of portion of matter) and at the same time an object (ingot). As a material it has the qualities of a material, namely the chemical composition. As an ingot it has the quality of an object, namely its mass. Note that the types of the qualities are different: objects have extensive qualities (subclass of quality), which scale with the size of the object while portions of matter have intensive qualities (subclass of quality) that are independent of the portions size.
