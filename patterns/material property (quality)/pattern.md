- **Purpose**: Represent materials, their qualities, and their behaviors at different moments/periods of time.
- **Example Use Case**: 
This example defines a set of example individuals illustrating how materials, their qualities, and their behaviors can be semantically represented. 
The example models three main themes:

	1. Intrinsic material qualities: Examples include mass, and density.
		
		- A metal sheet is modeled as a material object that has a mass quality with a given numeric value (3.3 g).
		- A steel material has an associated density quality (7.5 g/cm³).

	2. Behavioral material properties and processes: These represent how a material behaves under certain conditions.
		- A steel material has a melting point (1500 °C), which is realized through a melting process.
		- The melting process is triggered by an application of heat flux and involves a change of temperature as the material responds.

	3. Relational material qualities: These capture qualities that depend on relations between materials and objects.
		- A mass proportion is expressed between some portion of iron and the metal sheet, with a value of 97.7 %.
