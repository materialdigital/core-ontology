Aligning with the ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 standard, PMDco constructed on basis of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and reuses several BFO-aligned ontologies like RO, IAO, and OBI. The scope of PMDco follows the fundamental paradigm of MSE (processing, structure, and properties) and encompasses the following domains: 
(*) Processes: Representation of MSE-related process chains, including materials manufacturing, characterization, and simulation processes.
(*) Structure/state: Description of substances, engineered materials, and specification of materials, their composition, and multiscale structural features.
(*) Properties: Specification of material properties and qualities, representing processing-structure-properties dependences.
PMDco also provides general entities required for representing the fundamental MSE topics (e.g., thermodynamics), as well as general semantics for entities commonly required across MSE disciplines (such as devices, roles, functions, and plans).

The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with."""@en ,

From the second IAO workshop, various comments, [commented on by Alan Ruttenberg 8/6/2009]

unit of measure is a quality, e.g. the length of a ruler.

[We decided to hedge on what units of measure are, instead talking about measurement unit labels, which are the information content entities that are about whatever measurement units are. For IAO we need that information entity in any case. See the term measurement unit label]

[Some struggling with the various subflavors of is_about. We subsequently removed the relation represents, and describes until and only when we have a better theory]

a represents b means either a denotes b or a describes

describe:
a describes b means a is about b and a allows an inference of at least one quality of b

We have had a long discussion about denotes versus describes."""@en ,

First, SDC is dependent on a IC. As RO does not have \"bearer of\" object property, the \"has characteristic\" implies that the domain should be an IC. 

Second, characteristic of is a functional property. Thus, two triples SDC_1 characteristc of IC_1 and SDC_2  characteristc of Process_1 (where IC_1 participates in Process_1), cannot exist simultaneously. 
An example of such case can be \"Temperature of during the annealing process was 1000°C\". Temperature is an SDC of some participant of the annealing, however it is not clear whether it is an SDC of an oven or of a sample in the oven. If we assert triple Annealing--> has characteristic --> Temperature 1000°C, then the correct triple connecting temperature SDC with either oven or specimen cannot exist."""@en ;

                obo:IAO_0000116 """BP: The definition summarizes long email discussions on the OBI developer, roles, biomaterial and denrie branches. It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:

1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch
editor), with individual persons as bearers

2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)

3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles
there are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the
charter/rules/bylaws themselves.

It is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent
continuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the
bearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define
organization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to
all kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.

Interestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place
organization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,
Government Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,
W3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.

This leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -
3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its
current place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to
'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue
for now."""@en ;

Der Griff ermöglicht es dem Benutzer, die Säge von Hand zu führen und den Schnitt durch Vor- und Zurückbewegen des Blatts zu erzeugen. Handsägen sind in verschiedenen Ausführungen erhältlich, je nach der beabsichtigten Anwendung. Es gibt beispielsweise Handsägen für Holz, Metall oder Kunststoff, und sie können unterschiedliche Zahngeometrien und Blattlängen aufweisen, um optimal auf verschiedene Schneidanforderungen abgestimmt zu sein."@de ,

This type of saw typically consists of a long, thin blade with teeth attached to a handle. The handle allows the user to guide the saw by hand and make the cut by moving the blade back and forth. Handsaws are available in different designs, depending on the intended application. For example, there are handsaws for wood, metal or plastic, and they can have different tooth geometries and blade lengths to best suit different cutting requirements."@en .
