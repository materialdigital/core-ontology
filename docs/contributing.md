# How to contribute to PMDco

## Contribute via GitHub issues

We use **GitHub Issues** to streamline and document contributions to our ontology development process. Whether you’re reporting a problem, suggesting improvements, or proposing new concepts, GitHub Issues is the primary platform for collaboration.  

Here you can find the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology).

### How It Works  

1. **Access the Repository Issue Tracker**  
   Visit the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology) of our GitHub repository where the ontology project is hosted. 

2. **Open a New Issue**  
   - Click on the **“Issues”** tab in the repository menu.  
   - Select **“New Issue”** and provide a clear, descriptive title for your contribution.  

3. **Provide Detailed Information**  
   - In the issue body, describe your suggestion or concern in detail. Be specific and include relevant context, such as:  
     - Terms/concepts involved.  
     - Examples or use cases.  
     - References to existing ontology elements, if applicable.  
   - If you are reporting a bug or error, include steps to reproduce it.  

4. **Categorize Your Issue**  
   - Use available **labels** (e.g., *bug*, *enhancement*, *question*) to categorize your issue. This helps others understand its nature at a glance.  

5. **Engage in Discussion**  
   - Once submitted, your issue may receive feedback or questions from other contributors or maintainers.  
   - Please respond promptly to keep the discussion active and collaborative.  

6. **Track Progress**  
   - You can monitor the status of your issue through updates and notifications. GitHub will alert you to any changes or resolutions.  

7. **Close the Issue**  
   - Once the issue has been addressed, either the maintainers or you (if appropriate) can close it.  

### Tips for Effective Contributions  

- **Be Clear and Concise**: Aim for clarity to ensure everyone understands your input.  
- **Use Markdown**: Format your text using GitHub-flavored Markdown for better readability.  
- **Stay Respectful**: Maintain a professional tone to foster constructive collaboration.
