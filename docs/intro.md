# Introduction

The **[Platform Material Digital](https://www.materialdigital.de/)** is an initiative based in Germany aimed at advancing the digitalization of materials science and engineering. It focuses on creating standardized digital tools, workflows, and infrastructures to unify and enhance the analysis, modeling, and sharing of material data. The platform promotes the integration of experimental and simulation-based data, enabling real-time analysis of materials through "digital twins" of components, which simulate how materials deform and fail during operations.
