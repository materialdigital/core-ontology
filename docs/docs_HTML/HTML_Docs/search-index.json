An ontology is a formally defined logical structure that represents concepts, categories, properties, and relationships within a specific scientific domain using standardized definitions and naming conventions. Ontologies provide a common language to describe data consistently, making raw information easier to organize, interpret, and share across different experiments, databases, and research disciplines. Read more: - Guarino, Nicola, Daniel Oberle, and Steffen Staab. \"What is an ontology?.\" Handbook on ontologies. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2009. 1-17. Why do we Need Ontologies? Ontologies are crucial for modern data management and digitalization because they provide a shared conceptual framework that defines relationships between data entities, ensuring interoperability and consistency across diverse systems. By organizing data using a formal structure, ontologies make information easier to integrate, search, and analyze, helping organizations transform raw, heterogeneous datasets into coherent digital knowledge assets. They support effective data governance by enabling clear definitions, data lineage tracking, and quality control throughout digital infrastructures. In the context of digital transformation, ontologies act as a universal language that connects data, systems, and processes across business domains, reducing silos and enabling automation, advanced analytics, and AI-driven decision-making. They are also integral to realizing the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) by embedding semantic meaning directly into data models, which promotes transparency, reproducibility, and long-term data sustainability. Without ontologies, organizations face fragmented data landscapes where digital information cannot be effectively reused or shared, hindering collaboration and innovation.

Its latest release, BFO 2020, provides a domain-neutral framework for consistent ontology development and forms the basis of the ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 standard for semantic interoperability. BFO is widely recognized as a preferred top-level ontology for building domain ontologies due to its philosophically grounded and logically rigorous foundations. Its domain-neutral nature, robust theoretical underpinnings, and modular, hierarchically structured design promote clarity, consistency, extensibility, and long-term maintainability. BFO also supports formal reasoning, enabling automated reasoning tools to validate logical coherence and uncover new insights, making it an effective framework for developing interoperable and semantically precise ontologies across diverse scientific and technical domains. BFO offers a systematic framework for categorizing entities based on their core characteristics and relationships, providing consistency in data classification and interoperability. It provides a formal, top-level hierarchy consisting of 36 classes, that categorizes all entities into two primary branches: “continuants” and “occurrents”. “Occurrents” are entities that unfold or happen over time, such as “processes” (e.g., a heating experiment) and “temporal regions” (e.g., time intervals in which processes occur). In contrast, “continuants” persist through time while possibly undergoing change, and further divided into independent and dependent continuants. “Independent continuants” include “material entities” (e.g., specimens, instruments) and “immaterial entities” (e.g., surfaces, boundaries) that exist on their own. “Specifically dependent continuants” depen", "headings": [{"text": "Reused Ontologies", "slug": "reused-ontologies", "content": "The PMDco complements and extends several existing ontologies by providing a mid-level framework tailored for the MSE domain.

Its primary mission is to establish a virtual materials data space that systematizes the handling of hierarchical, process-dependent materials data while ensuring semantic interoperability across decentralized and diverse servers. Rather than acting as a direct service provider, PMD focuses on developing prototype infrastructures and tool solutions to drive the digital transformation in materials science and engineering. It serves as a networking hub and communication interface (organizing webinars, events, and outreach activities) to connect stakeholders and foster collaboration between academic and industrial partners, ultimately strengthening Germany’s international competitiveness in materials digitalization. <img width=\"466\" height=\"294\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ce81b19-a8c5-458f-a503-948a90dbba43\" / Semantic interoperability working group The Semantic Interoperability Team within the Platform MaterialDigital (PMD) plays a key role in ensuring standardized, cross-domain data integration and communication across materials science initiatives. As the platform’s primary semantic backbone, the team is responsible for the development and maintenance of PMDco, the core ontology of PMD. Their work focuses on creating and sustaining frameworks that represent materials data in a consistent and meaningful way, enabling experimental, simulation, and characterization data to be linked, interpreted, and reused without ambiguity. To achieve this, they collaborate closely with ontology experts and materials science specialists to harmonize data models, establish metadata standards, and embed FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles throughout the PMD infrastructure.
