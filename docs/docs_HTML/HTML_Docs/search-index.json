With its latest version (v3.x.x), PMDco integrates a modular approach, aligning with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) standard to provide a comprehensive and interoperable framework for modeling materials, processes, and data. Scope The Platform MaterialDigital Core Ontology (PMDco) is a mid-level semantic framework for Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). Aligning with the ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 standard, PMDco constructed on basis of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and reuses several BFO-aligned ontologies like RO, IAO, and OBI. The scope of PMDco follows the fundamental paradigm of MSE (processing, structure, and properties) and encompasses the following domains: Processes: Representation of MSE-related process chains, including materials manufacturing, characterization, and simulation processes. Structure/state: Description of substances, engineered materials, and specification of materials, their composition, and multiscale structural features. Properties: Specification of material properties and qualities, representing processing-structure-properties dependences. PMDco also provides general entities required for representing the fundamental MSE topics (e.g., thermodynamics), as well as general semantics for entities commonly required across MSE disciplines (such as devices, roles, functions, and plans). Objectives - Semantic Interoperability: Facilitates consistent representation and exchange of materials data across domains and applications by bridging gaps between high-level and domain-specific ontologies. - FAIR Data Principles: Supports the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles, promoting structured data management and reusability. - Workflow Modeling: Provides tools to describe complex MSE workflows, including manufacturing, characterization, and data transformation processes. Key Features 1. Community-Driven Development: Refined collaboratively in the Ontology Playground sessions with input from MSE experts and practitioners. 2. Modular Design: Organized into distinct modules, such as Materials, Manufacturing, Characterization, Data Transformation, and Devices to cover the entire MSE lifecycle. 3. Alignment with Standards: Built on ISO-compliant BFO and integrates with related ontologies like OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigations) and IAO (Information Artifact Ontology). 4. Advanced Process Modeling: Enables detailed representation of processes and their substeps, capturing input/output relationships, device roles, and data transformations. 5. Reusability and Extensibility: Incorporates elements from established ontologies such as QUDT (for units and dimensions) and ChEBI (for chemical entities), ensuring broad applicability and cross-domain connectivity. Applications - Material Specifications: Models material properties and specifications, ensuring compliance with established standards (e.g., European Steel Grades). - Process Chains: Captures the sequence of interconnected processes, such as transforming a steel sheet into test pieces, performing tensile tests, and analyzing resulting data. - Data Integration and Analysis: Supports the transformation of raw data (e.g., time series) into derived material properties like elastic modulus, fostering reproducibility and transparency. - Device and Function Modeling: Links devices (e.g., forming machines) to their specifications and roles within processes, ensuring traceability and compliance. Competency questions To ensure the ontology captures the knowledge we need and supports the right queries, we defined a set of competency questions. These are practical, user-focused questions that the ontology should be able to answer once complete. They guide the development process and later serve as a benchmark to check whether the ontology meets its goals. Examples of these competency questions include: - Materials state/structure: - 1. What is the identifier X of material Y? - 2. What is the chemical composition of material X? - 3. What are the constituent substances of composite material X? - 4.

An ontology is a formally defined logical structure that represents concepts, categories, properties, and relationships within a specific scientific domain using standardized definitions and naming conventions. Ontologies provide a common language to describe data consistently, making raw information easier to organize, interpret, and share across different experiments, databases, and research disciplines. Read more: - Guarino, Nicola, Daniel Oberle, and Steffen Staab. \"What is an ontology?.\" Handbook on ontologies. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2009. 1-17. Why do we Need Ontologies? Ontologies are crucial for modern data management and digitalization because they provide a shared conceptual framework that defines relationships between data entities, ensuring interoperability and consistency across diverse systems. By organizing data using a formal structure, ontologies make information easier to integrate, search, and analyze, helping organizations transform raw, heterogeneous datasets into coherent digital knowledge assets. They support effective data governance by enabling clear definitions, data lineage tracking, and quality control throughout digital infrastructures. In the context of digital transformation, ontologies act as a universal language that connects data, systems, and processes across business domains, reducing silos and enabling automation, advanced analytics, and AI-driven decision-making. They are also integral to realizing the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) by embedding semantic meaning directly into data models, which promotes transparency, reproducibility, and long-term data sustainability. Without ontologies, organizations face fragmented data landscapes where digital information cannot be effectively reused or shared, hindering collaboration and innovation. Motivation for Developing Ontologies in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) The motivation for developing MSE ontologies arises from the increasing demand to organize, integrate, and exploit the rapidly growing volume of heterogeneous data produced across the field. MSE is undergoing a major digital transformation, driven by the need for data-driven innovation, sustainability, and accelerated materials discovery. As an interdisciplinary domain, MSE combines physics, chemistry, and engineering to understand and optimize the relationships between material processing, structure, properties, and performance (PSPP). It spans the full materials lifecycle (from raw material extraction to product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recycling) and supports key technological sectors including energy, aerospace, electronics, automotive, and healthcare. Motivation for the Semantic Representation of Materials Life Cycle via PMDco This complexity leads to diverse experimental methods, simulation techniques, and industrial processes, all generating data with different formats, terminologies, and metadata requirements. Without a shared semantic foundation, such diversity makes it difficult to connect, compare, or reuse data across laboratories, instruments, and software tools. As a result, valuable knowledge remains siloed, limiting reproducibility and slowing down scientific progress. Ontologies address these challenges by providing standardized vocabularies and formal semantic relationships that ensure consistent description of materials and their behaviors. By harmonizing data models and bridging conceptual and domain-specific knowledge, ontologies enable semantic interoperability, allowing data to be seamlessly exchanged, integrated, and interpreted across scales, methods, and organizations. This is essential for applying the FAIR principles, ensuring that MSE data becomes both human-understandable and machine-actionable for advanced analytics, automation, and AI-driven research. In addition, ontology-based data representation improves data quality by capturing dependencies (e.g., process–structure relationships), enforcing consistency, and reducing ambiguity in interpretation. Enhanced provenance and metadata standards further support reproducibility, traceability, and credibility in research outcomes. These capabilities are crucial for emerging digital concepts such as materials informatics, workflow automation, and digital twins, which rely on robust links between experimental and computational knowledge. The development of PMDco specifically targets several critical challenges within the MSE landscape: - Heterogeneous terminology, stemming from diverse subdomains and industrial practices - Lack of standardized data structures, especially across experimental, simulation, and manufacturing environments - Sparse or missing metadata, which restricts data reuse and reproducibility - Semantic misalignment between generic models and specialized domain knowledge, limiting cross-disciplinary collaboration By functioning as a mid-level ontology for MSE, PMDco provides a common semantic backbone for the Platform MaterialDigital ecosystem. It supports automated data integration, harmonizes terminology and processes, and enables coherent knowledge representation throughout the materials lifecycle. Ultimately, the development of MSE ontologies represents a strategic step toward a more efficient, connected, and intelligent research ecosystem — accelerating innovation while promoting sustainable and FAIR data practices. Ontology Levels and Example MSE-Related Ontologies Based on the degree of abstraction and formal expressiveness, the ontologies are classified into the following four levels: 1) Top-level ontologies (TLOs) describe common general concepts across various domains at the highest possible level of abstraction. TLOs establish semantic standards and incorporate universal and fundamental concepts to ensure the connection and interoperability of a wide range of conceivable domain ontologies. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) https://github.com/bfo-ontology/BFO-2020, Eelementary Multiperspective mMaterial Ontology (EMMO) https://emmo-repo.github.io/, descriptive ontology for linguistic and cognitive engineering (DOLCE) https://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/index.php/dolce/, suggested upper merged ontology (SUMO) https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo, and semanticscience integrated ontology (SIO) https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/semanticscience are TLOs that were mostly reused for developing the ontologies in the MSE domain. 2) Mid-level ontologies (MLOs) add finer granular entities to the TLOs and make them more modular to enable interconnecting of the complex and expressive domain-level ontologies (DLOs). For example, ontology of biomedical investigations (OBI) https://obi-ontology.org/, NFDIcore ontology https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore, and industrial ontologies foundry (IOF) core https://github.com/iofoundry/ontology are the MLOs that are established based on the BFO TPO. 3) Domain-level ontologies (DLOs) contain highly expressive and explicit expert knowledge and represent concepts, definitions, facts, statements, axioms, rules, and relations that belong to specific domains. Until now, a variety of DLOs were introduced in the domain of materials science, which were designed based on different types of TLOs and MLOs. For instance, MSEO https://github.com/Mat-O-Lab/MSEO is a DLO that reuses BFO and IOF core and represents extensive semantics in the domain of materials science and engineering. 4) Application-level ontologies (ALOs) provide highly detailed semantics for specific use cases and support the development of knowledge graphs. For example, tensile test ontology (TTO), fatigue testing ontology (FTO), and Vickers testing ontology (VTO) in the domain of materials mechanical testing. More examples for MSE ontologies can be found in MatPortal https://matportal.org/, the ontology repository for materials science.

Norouzi, Ebrahim, Jörg Waitelonis, and Harald Sack. \"The landscape of ontologies in materials science and engineering: A survey and evaluation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.06034 (2024). Ontology Language The ontology is implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) https://www.w3.org/OWL/, a powerful and widely used language for creating complex and interoperable ontologies. OWL supports logical reasoning and facilitates the integration of machine-readable data with semantic web technologies. Furthermore, different notations and formats may be used. Typically, PMDco is also provided in Turtle (TTL) https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/ syntax. Key Components of an Ontology - Class: A class provides an abstraction mechanism for grouping resources with similar characteristics. Every class is associated with a set of individuals, called the class extension. The individuals in the class extension are called the instances of the class. A class has an intentional meaning i.e., the underlying concept. - Object Property: The relationship of an individual to another individual. An object property is defined as an instance of the built-in OWL class owl:ObjectProperty. - Datatype Property: Datatype properties link individuals to data values. A datatype property is defined as an instance of the built-in OWL class owl:DatatypeProperty. - Instance: Individual realization of a concept. For example, the concept tensile test may be instantiated with a particular tensile test that occurred at a particular time at a particular location and with particular parameters. All instantiations together represent the ontology A-Box, where statements are made about instances using the terminology defined in the T-Box.

By organizing data using a formal structure, ontologies make information easier to integrate, search, and analyze, helping organizations transform raw, heterogeneous datasets into coherent digital knowledge assets. They support effective data governance by enabling clear definitions, data lineage tracking, and quality control throughout digital infrastructures. In the context of digital transformation, ontologies act as a universal language that connects data, systems, and processes across business domains, reducing silos and enabling automation, advanced analytics, and AI-driven decision-making. They are also integral to realizing the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) by embedding semantic meaning directly into data models, which promotes transparency, reproducibility, and long-term data sustainability. Without ontologies, organizations face fragmented data landscapes where digital information cannot be effectively reused or shared, hindering collaboration and innovation.", "keywords": "AI FAIR Need OWL Ontologies?

MSE is undergoing a major digital transformation, driven by the need for data-driven innovation, sustainability, and accelerated materials discovery. As an interdisciplinary domain, MSE combines physics, chemistry, and engineering to understand and optimize the relationships between material processing, structure, properties, and performance (PSPP). It spans the full materials lifecycle (from raw material extraction to product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recycling) and supports key technological sectors including energy, aerospace, electronics, automotive, and healthcare. Motivation for the Semantic Representation of Materials Life Cycle via PMDco This complexity leads to diverse experimental methods, simulation techniques, and industrial processes, all generating data with different formats, terminologies, and metadata requirements. Without a shared semantic foundation, such diversity makes it difficult to connect, compare, or reuse data across laboratories, instruments, and software tools. As a result, valuable knowledge remains siloed, limiting reproducibility and slowing down scientific progress. Ontologies address these challenges by providing standardized vocabularies and formal semantic relationships that ensure consistent description of materials and their behaviors. By harmonizing data models and bridging conceptual and domain-specific knowledge, ontologies enable semantic interoperability, allowing data to be seamlessly exchanged, integrated, and interpreted across scales, methods, and organizations. This is essential for applying the FAIR principles, ensuring that MSE data becomes both human-understandable and machine-actionable for advanced analytics, automation, and AI-driven research. In addition, ontology-based data representation improves data quality by capturing dependencies (e.g., process–structure relationships), enforcing consistency, and reducing ambiguity in interpretation. Enhanced provenance and metadata standards further support reproducibility, traceability, and credibility in research outcomes. These capabilities are crucial for emerging digital concepts such as materials informatics, workflow automation, and digital twins, which rely on robust links between experimental and computational knowledge. The development of PMDco specifically targets several critical challenges within the MSE landscape: - Heterogeneous terminology, stemming from diverse subdomains and industrial practices - Lack of standardized data structures, especially across experimental, simulation, and manufacturing environments - Sparse or missing metadata, which restricts data reuse and reproducibility - Semantic misalignment between generic models and specialized domain knowledge, limiting cross-disciplinary collaboration By functioning as a mid-level ontology for MSE, PMDco provides a common semantic backbone for the Platform MaterialDigital ecosystem. It supports automated data integration, harmonizes terminology and processes, and enables coherent knowledge representation throughout the materials lifecycle. Ultimately, the development of MSE ontologies represents a strategic step toward a more efficient, connected, and intelligent research ecosystem — accelerating innovation while promoting sustainable and FAIR data practices.", "keywords": "(MSE) AI Developing Engineering FAIR MSE MaterialDigital Materials Motivation OWL Ontologies PMD PMDco PSPP Science URI and assets domain edge experiment for material metadata ontology process relation semantic workflow"}, {"text": "Ontology Levels and Example MSE-Related Ontologies", "slug": "ontology-levels-and-example-mse-related-ontologies", "level": 2, "content": "Based on the degree of abstraction and formal expressiveness, the ontologies are classified into the following four levels: 1) Top-level ontologies (TLOs) describe common general concepts across various domains at the highest possible level of abstraction. TLOs establish semantic standards and incorporate universal and fundamental concepts to ensure the connection and interoperability of a wide range of conceivable domain ontologies. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) https://github.com/bfo-ontology/BFO-2020, Eelementary Multiperspective mMaterial Ontology (EMMO) https://emmo-repo.github.io/, descriptive ontology for linguistic and cognitive engineering (DOLCE) https://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/index.php/dolce/, suggested upper merged ontology (SUMO) https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo, and semanticscience integrated ontology (SIO) https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/semanticscience are TLOs that were mostly reused for developing the ontologies in the MSE domain. 2) Mid-level ontologies (MLOs) add finer granular entities to the TLOs and make them more modular to enable interconnecting of the complex and expressive domain-level ontologies (DLOs). For example, ontology of biomedical investigations (OBI) https://obi-ontology.org/, NFDIcore ontology https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore, and industrial ontologies foundry (IOF) core https://github.com/iofoundry/ontology are the MLOs that are established based on the BFO TPO. 3) Domain-level ontologies (DLOs) contain highly expressive and explicit expert knowledge and represent concepts, definitions, facts, statements, axioms, rules, and relations that belong to specific domains. Until now, a variety of DLOs were introduced in the domain of materials science, which were designed based on different types of TLOs and MLOs. For instance, MSEO https://github.com/Mat-O-Lab/MSEO is a DLO that reuses BFO and IOF core and represents extensive semantics in the domain of materials science and engineering. 4) Application-level ontologies (ALOs) provide highly detailed semantics for specific use cases and support the development of knowledge graphs. For example, tensile test ontology (TTO), fatigue testing ontology (FTO), and Vickers testing ontology (VTO) in the domain of materials mechanical testing. More examples for MSE ontologies can be found in MatPortal https://matportal.org/, the ontology repository for materials science.

They are engineered to support logic-based reasoning, interoperability, and tractable querying, allowing large or complex ontologies to be efficiently developed, understood, and maintained by dividing them into coherent, manageable parts. These modules make it possible to approach ontology engineering in a divide-and-conquer manner, facilitating reuse and integration across different domains and applications. PMDco defines six primary modules central to MSE, naming material, material qualities, material manufacturing, material characterization, data transformation, and devices. Furthermore, in ODK-based ontology modularization, modules such as import-edit, shared, and axioms-shared play distinct roles. The import-edit module contains external ontology terms and their logical extensions, supporting controlled editing and updates without manual changes to the imported content. The shared module aggregates terms or patterns that must be reused across different ontology parts, promoting interoperability between collections. The axioms-shared module collects logical axioms that are common and essential for reasoning across modules, ensuring consistency and coordination within the ontology system. As seen in below figure, PMDco is eventually created by unifying all mentioned ontology modules. PMDco V3.x.x modularization In a modularized ontology, key concepts such as classes and object properties are organized into distinct modules that capture specific domains or subdomains. Each module contains related classes, which denote the core concepts of the domain, along with their corresponding object properties, which describe relationships between these concepts and other entities. This structure allows for targeted development and maintenance, where groups of interrelated classes and properties can be managed, reused, and evolved independently while supporting interoperability through well-defined module boundaries. The complete list of PMDco classes, object properties, data properties, annotation properties and individuals can be found in the Widoco https://materialdigital.github.io/core-ontology/ documentation page. The following section provide example concepts related to different ontology modules. Classes 1. Materials module This category includes fundamental entities that represent physical materials, independent of their shape, and their compositional relationships. Examples: ` bfo:material entity – the main superclass for materials and objects from BFO. chebi:chemical entity - contains all the periodic elements imported from CHEBI ontology. pmd:Connected Material Entity Aggregate – A mereological sum of separate material entities, which adhere to one another through chemical bonds or physical junctions that go beyond gravity. Examples: the atoms of a molecule, the molecules forming the membrane of a cell, the epidermis in a human body. pmd:Disonnected Material Entity Aggregate – A mereological sum of scattered (i.e. spatially separated) material entities, which do not adhere to one another through chemical bonds or physical junctions but, instead, relate to one another merely on grounds of metric proximity. The material entities are separated from one another through space or through other material entities that do not belong to the group. Examples: a heap of stones, a colony of honeybees, a group of synapses. pmd:Material – A Portion Of Matter that may participate in some Manifacturing Process and whose shape is not relevant for its participation in the Manifacuring Process. Some concrete materials definitions: pmd:Metal - A metal is an engineered material representing a class of materials characterized by high electrical and thermal conductivity, ductility, and metallic bonding. pmd:Ceramics - Ceramics are engineered materials described as non-metallic, inorganic materials characterized by high hardness, brittleness, and heat resistance, commonly used in engineering applications. 2. Qualities module Material qualities define the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of materials that determine their behavior and usability in various applications. Main BFO superclasses: bfo:quality – A quality is a specifically dependent continuant that, in contrast to roles and dispositions, does not require any further process in order to be realized bfo:realizable entity - A specifically dependent continuant that inheres in continuant entities and are not exhibited in full at every time in which it inheres in an entity or group of entities. The exhibition or actualization of a realizable entity is a particular manifestation, functioning or process that occurs under certain circumstances. Examples from PMD: pmd:Extensive Quality - A quality that inheres in only object or object aggregate or fiat object part or chemical entity and is dependent on the bearers (system-) size. - Examples: - Pmd:Mass - A quality that inheres in an object, object aggregate or fiat object part and affects those in processes where gravitation, acceleration, thermal mass etc are relevant. - Pmd:Energy - A quality of material entities which manifests as a capacity to perform work (such as causing motion or the interaction of molecules) pmd:Intensive Quality - A qualty that inheres in only portion of matter and thus is independent of the bearers (system-) size. - Examples: - pmd:Chemical Composition - A morphological quality describing the types and proportions of elements or compounds present in a material. - pmd:Defect Density - A morphological quality describing the number of defects per unit volume or area in a material, which can affect its mechanical and electronic properties. pmd:Behavioral Material Property - A material trait in terms of the kind and magnitude of response to a specific imposed stimulus. Generally, definitions of properties are made independent of material shape and size. - Examples: - pmd:Hardness – A measure of a material’s resistance to deformation or indentation. - pmd:Morphological property – A material property representing the characteristics of a material's structure, such as shape, size, and distribution of its features. 3. Manufacturing module This category encompasses various processes and devices involved in the transformation of raw materials into finished products or components. The superclass for industrial processes: pmd:Manufacturing Process - A planned process that is driven by the primary intent to transform objectsA manufacturing process is always a transformative process. More specific examples: pmd:Coating – A manufacturing process that aims to deposit a permanently adhering layer of a material without a form onto a workpiece, whereby the immediate state of the coating material directly before application is essential. pmd:Forming - A manufacturing process that changes the shape of a solid body through plastic deformation while retaining both mass and structural integrity. pmd:Joining - A manufacturing process that enables the continuous bonding or joining of two or more workpieces with a specific, fixed shape or of such workpieces with a shapeless material, whereby the cohesion is created at specific points and reinforced overall. 4. Material characterization module Material characterization involves methods and devices used to analyze the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of materials. Main BFO superclass: bfo:process - p is a process means p is an occurrent that has some temporal proper part and for some time t, p has some material entity as participant The superclass for characterization processes: obi:Assay - A planned process that has the objective to produce information about a material entity (the evaluant) by examining it. More specific examples: pmd:Acoustical Property Analyzing Process - An assay that measures the acoustic properties of materials by analyzing how sound waves interact with the material. This process involves generating sound waves and observing their reflection, transmission, absorption, or scattering to determine properties such as acoustic impedance, absorption coefficient, and sound speed. pmd:Mechanical Property Analyzing Process - An assay that evaluates the mechanical characteristics of materials, such as strength, hardness, elasticity, and tensile properties, often through tests that measure response to forces and loads. pmd:Tensile Testing Process – A Mechanical Property Analyzing Process that determines a material's response to tensile forces, measuring its tensile strength, elongation, and Young's modulus. 5. Data transformation module This category includes processes that involve computational simulations and digital transformations related to material properties and behaviors. pmd:Computing Process - A planned process that involves the systematic use of computational methods and tools to perform simulations, analyses, or data transformations to achieve specific scientific or engineering goals. pmd:Simulation Process - A Computing Process that models the behavior of a system over time using mathematical or computational techniques. pmd:Monte Carlo Simulation - A Simulation Process that uses random sampling to solve physical and mathematical problems. 6. Devices module This category includes devices performing certain functions in industrial processes. Main BFO superclass: bfo:object - An object is a material entity which manifests causal unity & is of a type instances of which are maximal relative to the sort of causal unity manifested. Examples: pmd:Device - A physical or virtual entity used to perform a specific function or task, often involving measurement, manipulation, or analysis of materials. pmd:Furnace - An enclosed structure in which heat is produced (as for heating a house or for reducing ore). pmd:Creep Testing Device - A device used to test the creep behavior of materials under constant stress at high temperatures. Object Properties While most of PMDco object properties are driven from ro, bfo, iao and obi, many object properties also defined to represents more specific MSE relations. A portion of PMDco object properties hierarchy is shown here. As examples, we also introduced some object properties below: bfo:realizes – A relation between a process b and realizable entity c such that c inheres in some d & for all t, if b has participant d then c exists & the type instantiated by b is correlated with the type instantiated by c. ro:concretizes – A relationship between a specifically dependent continuant or process and a generically dependent continuant, in which the generically dependent continuant depends on some independent continuant in virtue of the fact that the specifically dependent continuant or process also depends on that same independent continuant. Multiple specifically dependent continuants or processes can concretize the same generically dependent continuant. iao:denotes – A primitive, instance-level, relation obtaining between an information content entity and some portion of reality. Denotation is what happens when someone creates an information content entity E in order to specifically refer to something. The only relation between E and the thing is that E can be used to 'pick out' the thing. This relation connects those two together. Freedictionary.com sense 3: To signify directly; refer to specifically. obi:has value specification – A relation between an information content entity and a value specification that specifies its value. pmd:consist of – A continuant part property that relates Material Entity Aggregates in the direction of smaller length-scale. pmd:intracts with – A relation between participants of a process indicating that some of the participants SDCs are affected during the process due to the interaction of the participants. pmd:stimulates – A relation between a stimulating process and material property, where there is some material entity that is bearer of the material property and participates in the stimulating process, and the material property comes to be realized in the course of the stimulating process. Note that PMDco uses specific constraints and rules to ensure logical consistency and facilitate accurate data representation within the ontology: - Property characteristics: Ontology properties have several key characteristics that define their behavior and impact reasoning. Properties can be functional, meaning each individual has at most one value for a property. They may be inverse functional, so each value points to at most one individual. Properties can also be transitive, allowing chains of relationships to infer new ones, or symmetric, meaning relationships go both ways between individuals. Other characteristics include asymmetric (relationships do not reverse), reflexive (every individual relates to itself), and irreflexive (no individual relates to itself). These characteristics are essential for accurately modeling domain relationships and constraints in ontologies. - Cardinality Constraints: the number of times a property can be associated with a class. For example, a Manufacturing Process may be constrained to have some material entity as input using the hasspecifiedinput property. - Domain and Range Specifications: Define the applicable classes for properties. For example, the stimulates property (subproperty of realizes) has a domain of Stimulating Process and a range of Material Property. Data Properties iao:has measurement value – obi:has specified value – A relation between a value specification and a literal. pmd:has value – Data property that relates an information content entity to a literal Annotation properties PMDco employs annotations to enrich classes and properties with metadata and human readable information, enhancing clarity and usability. This information may be provided in different natural languages (e.g., English and German). - Labels rdfs:label: Provide human-readable names for ontology elements. - Comments rdfs:comment: Offer detailed descriptions, usage notes, clarifications of definitions, or additional relevant information. They may enhance the understanding of the terms regarded. - Definitions skos:definition: Delivers formal, human readable explanations and descriptions of classes and properties. Preferably, Aristotelian definitions #aristotelian-definition are used that support in finding subclass relationships. - Definition Source obo:IAO_0000119: If the definition was obtained from a specific source (e.g., a well-known work from the field of MSE, a dictionary, or a URI/URL), this is specified as definition source, also citing the original document. As examples, the annotation for pmd:Material class and ro:has quality object property are shown in below figures: - Note that, for providing the definitions in PMDcore ontology we follow the Aristotelian https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Aristotelian principle. An aristotelian definition typically refers to defining something by its genus (general category) and differentia (specific characteristics that distinguish it from other members of the same genus), that should be expressed in the concepts defined in the ontology. Individuals While PMDco serves as a mid-level ontology and may not define specific instances, it provides a framework for users to instantiate individuals pertinent to their domain. Therefore, it mostly does not contain individuals in its pure form. The only individuals present in the PMDco are the ones belonging to the subclasses of a pmd:Nature Constant class, defined in the Qualities module: pmd:Aggregate State Value - solid, liquid, etc.

are formally defined, self-contained, and reusable fragments of an ontology that represent specific conceptual subdomains. They are engineered to support logic-based reasoning, interoperability, and tractable querying, allowing large or complex ontologies to be efficiently developed, understood, and maintained by dividing them into coherent, manageable parts. These modules make it possible to approach ontology engineering in a divide-and-conquer manner, facilitating reuse and integration across different domains and applications. PMDco defines six primary modules central to MSE, naming material, material qualities, material manufacturing, material characterization, data transformation, and devices. Furthermore, in ODK-based ontology modularization, modules such as import-edit, shared, and axioms-shared play distinct roles. The import-edit module contains external ontology terms and their logical extensions, supporting controlled editing and updates without manual changes to the imported content. The shared module aggregates terms or patterns that must be reused across different ontology parts, promoting interoperability between collections. The axioms-shared module collects logical axioms that are common and essential for reasoning across modules, ensuring consistency and coordination within the ontology system. As seen in below figure, PMDco is eventually created by unifying all mentioned ontology modules. PMDco V3.x.x modularization In a modularized ontology, key concepts such as classes and object properties are organized into distinct modules that capture specific domains or subdomains. Each module contains related classes, which denote the core concepts of the domain, along with their corresponding object properties, which describe relationships between these concepts and other entities. This structure allows for targeted development and maintenance, where groups of interrelated classes and properties can be managed, reused, and evolved independently while supporting interoperability through well-defined module boundaries. The complete list of PMDco classes, object properties, data properties, annotation properties and individuals can be found in the Widoco https://materialdigital.github.io/core-ontology/ documentation page. The following section provide example concepts related to different ontology modules.", "keywords": "MSE Modularization ODK PMD PMDco URI annotation assets axiom characterization class device domain import individual material module object ontology pattern reasoning relation"}, {"text": "Classes", "slug": "classes", "level": 2, "content": "1. Materials module This category includes fundamental entities that represent physical materials, independent of their shape, and their compositional relationships. Examples: ` bfo:material entity – the main superclass for materials and objects from BFO. chebi:chemical entity - contains all the periodic elements imported from CHEBI ontology. pmd:Connected Material Entity Aggregate – A mereological sum of separate material entities, which adhere to one another through chemical bonds or physical junctions that go beyond gravity. Examples: the atoms of a molecule, the molecules forming the membrane of a cell, the epidermis in a human body. pmd:Disonnected Material Entity Aggregate – A mereological sum of scattered (i.e. spatially separated) material entities, which do not adhere to one another through chemical bonds or physical junctions but, instead, relate to one another merely on grounds of metric proximity. The material entities are separated from one another through space or through other material entities that do not belong to the group. Examples: a heap of stones, a colony of honeybees, a group of synapses. pmd:Material – A Portion Of Matter that may participate in some Manifacturing Process and whose shape is not relevant for its participation in the Manifacuring Process. Some concrete materials definitions: pmd:Metal - A metal is an engineered material representing a class of materials characterized by high electrical and thermal conductivity, ductility, and metallic bonding. pmd:Ceramics - Ceramics are engineered materials described as non-metallic, inorganic materials characterized by high hardness, brittleness, and heat resistance, commonly used in engineering applications. 2. Qualities module Material qualities define the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of materials that determine their behavior and usability in various applications. Main BFO superclasses: bfo:quality – A quality is a specifically dependent continuant that, in contrast to roles and dispositions, does not require any further process in order to be realized bfo:realizable entity - A specifically dependent continuant that inheres in continuant entities and are not exhibited in full at every time in which it inheres in an entity or group of entities. The exhibition or actualization of a realizable entity is a particular manifestation, functioning or process that occurs under certain circumstances. Examples from PMD: pmd:Extensive Quality - A quality that inheres in only object or object aggregate or fiat object part or chemical entity and is dependent on the bearers (system-) size. - Examples: - Pmd:Mass - A quality that inheres in an object, object aggregate or fiat object part and affects those in processes where gravitation, acceleration, thermal mass etc are relevant. - Pmd:Energy - A quality of material entities which manifests as a capacity to perform work (such as causing motion or the interaction of molecules) pmd:Intensive Quality - A qualty that inheres in only portion of matter and thus is independent of the bearers (system-) size. - Examples: - pmd:Chemical Composition - A morphological quality describing the types and proportions of elements or compounds present in a material. - pmd:Defect Density - A morphological quality describing the number of defects per unit volume or area in a material, which can affect its mechanical and electronic properties. pmd:Behavioral Material Property - A material trait in terms of the kind and magnitude of response to a specific imposed stimulus. Generally, definitions of properties are made independent of material shape and size. - Examples: - pmd:Hardness – A measure of a material’s resistance to deformation or indentation. - pmd:Morphological property – A material property representing the characteristics of a material's structure, such as shape, size, and distribution of its features. 3. Manufacturing module This category encompasses various processes and devices involved in the transformation of raw materials into finished products or components. The superclass for industrial processes: pmd:Manufacturing Process - A planned process that is driven by the primary intent to transform objectsA manufacturing process is always a transformative process. More specific examples: pmd:Coating – A manufacturing process that aims to deposit a permanently adhering layer of a material without a form onto a workpiece, whereby the immediate state of the coating material directly before application is essential. pmd:Forming - A manufacturing process that changes the shape of a solid body through plastic deformation while retaining both mass and structural integrity. pmd:Joining - A manufacturing process that enables the continuous bonding or joining of two or more workpieces with a specific, fixed shape or of such workpieces with a shapeless material, whereby the cohesion is created at specific points and reinforced overall. 4. Material characterization module Material characterization involves methods and devices used to analyze the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of materials. Main BFO superclass: bfo:process - p is a process means p is an occurrent that has some temporal proper part and for some time t, p has some material entity as participant The superclass for characterization processes: obi:Assay - A planned process that has the objective to produce information about a material entity (the evaluant) by examining it. More specific examples: pmd:Acoustical Property Analyzing Process - An assay that measures the acoustic properties of materials by analyzing how sound waves interact with the material. This process involves generating sound waves and observing their reflection, transmission, absorption, or scattering to determine properties such as acoustic impedance, absorption coefficient, and sound speed. pmd:Mechanical Property Analyzing Process - An assay that evaluates the mechanical characteristics of materials, such as strength, hardness, elasticity, and tensile properties, often through tests that measure response to forces and loads. pmd:Tensile Testing Process – A Mechanical Property Analyzing Process that determines a material's response to tensile forces, measuring its tensile strength, elongation, and Young's modulus. 5. Data transformation module This category includes processes that involve computational simulations and digital transformations related to material properties and behaviors. pmd:Computing Process - A planned process that involves the systematic use of computational methods and tools to perform simulations, analyses, or data transformations to achieve specific scientific or engineering goals. pmd:Simulation Process - A Computing Process that models the behavior of a system over time using mathematical or computational techniques. pmd:Monte Carlo Simulation - A Simulation Process that uses random sampling to solve physical and mathematical problems. 6. Devices module This category includes devices performing certain functions in industrial processes. Main BFO superclass: bfo:object - An object is a material entity which manifests causal unity & is of a type instances of which are maximal relative to the sort of causal unity manifested. Examples: pmd:Device - A physical or virtual entity used to perform a specific function or task, often involving measurement, manipulation, or analysis of materials. pmd:Furnace - An enclosed structure in which heat is produced (as for heating a house or for reducing ore). pmd:Creep Testing Device ` - A device used to test the creep behavior of materials under constant stress at high temperatures.", "keywords": "BFO CHEBI Classes OWL PMD PMDco TTL URI analysis assets bfo:material bfo:object bfo:process bfo:quality bfo:realizable characterization chebi:chemical class device entity import instance main material materialdigital measurement module module_indicator obi:Assay object ontology pmd:Acoustical pmd:Behavioral pmd:Ceramics pmd:Chemical pmd:Coating pmd:Computing pmd:Connected pmd:Creep pmd:Defect pmd:Device pmd:Disonnected pmd:Extensive pmd:Forming pmd:Furnace pmd:Hardness pmd:Intensive pmd:Joining pmd:Manufacturing pmd:Material pmd:Mechanical pmd:Metal pmd:Monte pmd:Morphological pmd:Simulation pmd:Tensile process property refs relation shape superclass unit"}, {"text": "Object Properties", "slug": "object-properties", "level": 2, "content": "While most of PMDco object properties are driven from ro, bfo, iao and obi, many object properties also defined to represents more specific MSE relations. A portion of PMDco object properties hierarchy is shown here. As examples, we also introduced some object properties below: ` bfo:realizes – A relation between a process b and realizable entity c such that c inheres in some d & for all t, if b has participant d then c exists & the type instantiated by b is correlated with the type instantiated by c. ro:concretizes – A relationship between a specifically dependent continuant or process and a generically dependent continuant, in which the generically dependent continuant depends on some independent continuant in virtue of the fact that the specifically dependent continuant or process also depends on that same independent continuant. Multiple specifically dependent continuants or processes can concretize the same generically dependent continuant. iao:denotes – A primitive, instance-level, relation obtaining between an information content entity and some portion of reality. Denotation is what happens when someone creates an information content entity E in order to specifically refer to something. The only relation between E and the thing is that E can be used to 'pick out' the thing. This relation connects those two together. Freedictionary.com sense 3: To signify directly; refer to specifically. obi:has value specification – A relation between an information content entity and a value specification that specifies its value. pmd:consist of – A continuant part property that relates Material Entity Aggregates in the direction of smaller length-scale. pmd:intracts with – A relation between participants of a process indicating that some of the participants SDCs are affected during the process due to the interaction of the participants. pmd:stimulates ` – A relation between a stimulating process and material property, where there is some material entity that is bearer of the material property and participates in the stimulating process, and the material property comes to be realized in the course of the stimulating process. Note that PMDco uses specific constraints and rules to ensure logical consistency and facilitate accurate data representation within the ontology: - Property characteristics: Ontology properties have several key characteristics that define their behavior and impact reasoning. Properties can be functional, meaning each individual has at most one value for a property. They may be inverse functional, so each value points to at most one individual. Properties can also be transitive, allowing chains of relationships to infer new ones, or symmetric, meaning relationships go both ways between individuals. Other characteristics include asymmetric (relationships do not reverse), reflexive (every individual relates to itself), and irreflexive (no individual relates to itself). These characteristics are essential for accurately modeling domain relationships and constraints in ontologies. - Cardinality Constraints: the number of times a property can be associated with a class. For example, a Manufacturing Process may be constrained to have some material entity as input using the hasspecifiedinput property. - Domain and Range Specifications: Define the applicable classes for properties. For example, the stimulates property (subproperty of realizes) has a domain of Stimulating Process and a range of Material Property.", "keywords": "BFO MSE Object PMD PMDco Properties URI assets bfo:realizes cardinality class constraint domain entity has_specified_input hierarchy iao:denotes individual instance material obi:has object ontology pmd:consist pmd:intracts pmd:stimulates process property property_indicator range reasoning relation ro:concretizes value"}, {"text": "Data Properties", "slug": "data-properties", "level": 2, "content": "` iao:has measurement value – obi:has specified value – A relation between a value specification and a literal. pmd:has value ` – Data property that relates an information content entity to a literal", "keywords": "Data PMD Properties entity iao:has literal measurement obi:has pmd:has property property_indicator relation value"}, {"text": "Annotation properties", "slug": "annotation-properties", "level": 2, "content": "PMDco employs annotations to enrich classes and properties with metadata and human readable information, enhancing clarity and usability.

These patterns provide standardized, reusable semantic snippets that facilitate consistent representation of relationships between instances and entities. Furthermore, such patterns may be used to create SHACL shapes to include constraints in a knowledge representation. By following usage patterns, ontology users and developers can ensure uniformity, clarity, and reusability in their models. The sections below illustrate how to read and apply these patterns. Each pattern includes its purpose, description, relevant properties, visualization, and example. Pattern 1 - Duality of object and material - Purpose: Represents how objects and portions of matter are the same material entity, like a statue that is at the same time a portion of clay. - Example Use Case: The example describes an entity that is a material (steel, subsubclass of portion of matter) and at the same time an object (ingot). As a material it has the qualities of a material, namely the chemical composition. As an ingot it has the quality of an object, namely its mass. Note that the types of the qualities are different: objects have extensive qualities (subclass of quality), which scale with the size of the object while portions of matter have intensive qualities (subclass of quality) that are independent of the portions size. code (see folder: patterns/duality object material/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/duality%20object%20material ) --- Pattern 2 - Temporal Region - Purpose: Specifying the boundaries of a process on the time axis. - Description: This graph describes a set of temporal relationships among processes, temporal regions, and continuant entities. The graph models how different kinds of entities relate to time and duration through their association with temporal regions and instants. Within this model, there are two processes — (ex:process1) and (ex:process2) — each representing an occurrence or event that unfolds over time. Both processes are linked to distinct one-dimensional temporal regions (ex:period1, ex:period2), via the occupiestemporalregion property. This expresses that each process extends through a particular temporal duration. The temporal structure is further refined through hierarchical and boundary definitions. The region (ex:period1) is described as a propertemporalpartof (ex:period2), indicating that the first period is entirely contained within the second, but not identical to it. The larger region (ex:period2) has defined temporal boundaries: it hasfirstinstant (ex:start) and haslastinstant (ex:end), both of which are represented as zero-dimensional temporal regions, signifying discrete points in time marking the beginning and end of that duration. In addition to the processes and periods, the model includes a continuant entity, (ex:object1), which existsat a particular temporal region, (ex:sometime). This denotes that the continuant maintains existence at or during a specific time interval, emphasizing persistence or presence within the temporal framework. code code (see folder: patterns/temporal region/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/temporal%20region ) --- Pattern 3 - Process Chain - Purpose: Represent processes, consisting of simultaneous and serial subprocesses. - Description: This graph describes a structured process chain that organizes several interrelated process steps within a defined sequence. The graph defines relationships among processes using temporal and structural object properties. At the highest level, there is a parent process (ex:processparent), which serves as the overarching workflow. This process begins with (ex:processstep1) and concludes with (ex:processstep3), as indicated by the startswith and endswith relationships. The parent process is composed of several parts — specifically (ex:processstep1), (ex:processstep2a), (ex:processstep2b), and (ex:processstep3) — through the haspart property, defining the hierarchical structure of the process. The sequence begins with (ex:processstep1), which acts as the initial phase. This step precedes (ex:processstep2a), (ex:processstep2b), and (ex:processstep3), establishing it as the starting point from which subsequent processes emerge. Among the intermediate steps, (ex:processstep2a) and (ex:processstep2b) are connected not only sequentially but also through simultaneity: (ex:processstep2a) is defined as simultaneouswith (ex:processstep2b), indicating that they occur at the same time within the overall process. Finally, both (ex:processstep2a) and (ex:processstep2b) lead to (ex:processstep3), the final step of the chain. This closing process represents the conclusion of the overall workflow, marking the endpoint of the structured and partially parallel sequence defined in the RDF model. code code (see folder: patterns/process chain/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/process%20chain ) --- Pattern 4 - Process Inputs and Outputs - Purpose: Describes how to represent inputs and outputs for planned processes typically involving material entities or information-bearing entities. - Description: A planned process with possibility of multiple inputs and outputs, e.g., testing properties of a metallic sample, or transforming a piece of material into another product. - Further notes: There are also the properties has input http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO0002233 and has output http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO0002234 from RO. It is intended to use the OBI has specified input http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI0000293 and has specified output http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI0000299 on planned processes http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI0000011 (as also indicated by the domain of those) and the RO variant on other kinds of processes. code code (see folder: patterns/input and output of processes/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/input%20and%20output%20of%20processes ) --- Pattern 5 - Realizable Entities (Role) - Purpose: Represent characteristics of the objects, brought to existence by a specific situation. E.g. a role, which is realized in a process. - Description: This example describes how an object participates in a planned experimental process by bearing a specific evaluant role. An object, here ex:object1, is involved in a fatigue testing process, and this process takes the object as its specified input. The process is linked to an objective, and both the objective and the resulting output are explicitly stated to be about the same object, making clear that the purpose and outcome of the process concern that object. The object is assigned an evaluant role, ex:role1, and this role is realized in the execution of the fatigue testing process. In this way, the pattern connects object, role, process, objective, and result into a coherent structure showing that the object is the thing being evaluated in the process, and that the process executes and realizes the evaluant role associated with that object. code code (see folder: patterns/realizable entity (role)/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/realizable%20entity%20%28role%29 ) --- Pattern 6 - Material Properties (Qualities) - Purpose: Represent materials, their qualities, and their behaviors at different moments/periods of time. - Example Use Case: This example defines a set of example individuals illustrating how materials, their qualities, and their behaviors can be semantically represented. The example models three main themes: 1. Intrinsic material qualities: Examples include mass, and density. - A metal sheet is modeled as a material object that has a mass quality with a given numeric value (3.3 g). - A steel material has an associated density quality (7.5 g/cm³). 2. Behavioral material properties and processes: These represent how a material behaves under certain conditions. - A steel material has a melting point (1500 °C), which is realized through a melting process. - The melting process is triggered by an application of heat flux and involves a change of temperature as the material responds. 3. Relational material qualities: These capture qualities that depend on relations between materials and objects. - A mass proportion is expressed between some portion of iron and the metal sheet, with a value of 97.7 %. code (see folder: patterns/material property (quality)/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/material%20property%20%28quality%29 ) --- Pattern 7 - Measurement - Purpose: Represent measured value of some material characteristic. - Example Use Case: This example represents a measurement workflow: - An assay with an objective assesses a material entity. - The entity has a quality that the assay evaluates, there is also another quality which is not evaluates. - The assay produces a measurement datum representing the measurement result of that quality. - The datum includes a value specification providing numeric value and units. - The value specification also relates to the quality. code (see folder: patterns/measurement/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/measurement ) --- Pattern 8 - Scalar Value Specification - Purpose: Represents scalar physical quantities, combining a numerical value and a unit. - Core Properties: - obi:hasSpecifiedNumericValue - iao:hasMeasurementUnitLabel - iao:MeasurementUnitLabel - Example Use Case: The example describes a scalar value specification, ex:scalarvaluespecificationX, which is assigned a numeric value of 135.0 and linked to a measurement unit represented by the individual ex:unitX. The numeric value is provided via the OBI property hasspecifiednumericvalue, while the unit is associated through the IAO property hasmeasurementunitlabel. The unit individual ex:unitX is typed as a measurement unit label, but in practice this placeholder unit could be replaced by a formally defined unit from established ontologies such as UO (Units of Measurement Ontology) or QUDT (Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and Types). Together, the triples express that a value of 135.0 is specified in some unit, whether a custom one like ex:unitX or a standard unit drawn from UO or QUDT. code (see folder: patterns/scalar value specification/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/scalar%20value%20specification ) --- Pattern 9 - Categorical Value Specification - Purpose: Represents how categorical values such as ferrite, face-centered cubic, and liquid are used to specify the values of material characteristics. - Example Use Case: The example describes materials and the categorical qualities they might possess. In the first example, ex:fccmaterial is a material that has both a crystal structure and a grain structure. Its crystal structure quality is assigned the categorical value \"face-centered cubic\", and its grain structure quality is assigned the categorical value \"ferrite\", which is also explicitly stated to be about this same material. In other words, the material is characterized as having an FCC crystal structure and a ferritic grain structure. In the second example, ex:steelmelt is described as a melt that has an aggregate state quality. This quality is given the categorical value \"liquid\", indicating that the melt is in the liquid state. code (see folder: patterns/categorical value specification/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/categorical%20value%20specification ) --- Pattern 10 - Simulation input/output - Purpose: Information content entities as input and output of (simulation-)processes. - Example Use Case: A challenge arises when working with digital data about material entities, as is the case in simulations. Due to our ontological commitment to BFO, roles (like described in the patterns above) can only inhere in independent continuants, because a role is something that is physically realized when its bearer participates in a process. Information Content Entities (ICEs), such as datasets, specifications, or parameter files used in a simulation are generically dependent continuants. They are abstract contents that rely on some physical carrier (e.g., a hard drive) but do not themselves participate physically in a process. Assigning roles directly to ICEs would require the role to inhere in the ICE rather than in a material entity, which violates BFO's ontological constraints. To preserve the functionality of roles for informational inputs and outputs, we introduce process boundaries as \"input/output assignments\". In this pattern, an ICE participates in an input (or output) assignment, which is a dependent entity representing the assignment of that ICE to the process. The assignment itself is then part of the main process. This allows us to capture the role-like semantics of inputs and outputs without violating BFO's constraint that roles must inhere in material entities. Each assignment can be typed to specify its intended function in the process, while maintaining ontological consistency. For example, in a division calculation process, two numbers considered as ICE serve as inputs through role-like assignments: one as the numerator, and the other as the denominator. Each number participates in an input assignment that is part of the division process, while the resulting quotient participates in an output assignment. This pattern captures the functional roles of inputs and outputs without requiring the numbers themselves to bear roles directly, maintaining ontological consistency. code (see folder:

As a material it has the qualities of a material, namely the chemical composition. As an ingot it has the quality of an object, namely its mass.

The graph models how different kinds of entities relate to time and duration through their association with temporal regions and instants. Within this model, there are two processes — (ex:process1) and (ex:process2) — each representing an occurrence or event that unfolds over time. Both processes are linked to distinct one-dimensional temporal regions (ex:period1, ex:period2), via the occupiestemporalregion property. This expresses that each process extends through a particular temporal duration. The temporal structure is further refined through hierarchical and boundary definitions. The region (ex:period1) is described as a propertemporalpartof (ex:period2), indicating that the first period is entirely contained within the second, but not identical to it. The larger region (ex:period2) has defined temporal boundaries: it hasfirstinstant (ex:start) and haslastinstant (ex:end), both of which are represented as zero-dimensional temporal regions, signifying discrete points in time marking the beginning and end of that duration. In addition to the processes and periods, the model includes a continuant entity, (ex:object1), which existsat a particular temporal region, (ex:some_time). This denotes that the continuant maintains existence at or during a specific time interval, emphasizing persistence or presence within the temporal framework. code code (see folder: patterns/temporal

subprocesses. - Description: This graph describes a structured process chain that organizes several interrelated process steps within a defined sequence. The graph defines relationships among processes using temporal and structural object properties. At the highest level, there is a parent process (ex:processparent), which serves as the overarching workflow. This process begins with (ex:processstep1) and concludes with (ex:processstep3), as indicated by the startswith and endswith relationships. The parent process is composed of several parts — specifically (ex:processstep1), (ex:processstep2a), (ex:processstep2b), and (ex:processstep3) — through the haspart property, defining the hierarchical structure of the process. The sequence begins with (ex:processstep1), which acts as the initial phase. This step precedes (ex:processstep2a), (ex:processstep2b), and (ex:processstep3), establishing it as the starting point from which subsequent processes emerge. Among the intermediate steps, (ex:processstep2a) and (ex:processstep2b) are connected not only sequentially but also through simultaneity: (ex:processstep2a) is defined as simultaneouswith (ex:processstep2b), indicating that they occur at the same time within the overall process. Finally, both (ex:processstep2a) and (ex:processstep2b) lead to (ex:processstep3), the final step of the chain. This closing process represents the conclusion of the overall workflow, marking the endpoint of the structured and partially parallel sequence defined in the RDF model. code code (see folder: patterns/process chain/ https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns/process%20chain ) --- direction: up classes: { bfoclazz: { style: { fill: \"#dd42f5\" shadow: true border-radius: 5 font-color: white } } individual: { style: { fill: \"lightgrey\" } } } tbox.bfo*.class: bfoclazz tbox.label: \"\" tbox: { \"bfo:process\" -> \"bfo:occurrent\": \"rdfs:subClassOf\" } tbox.style.stroke: transparent tbox.style.fill: transparent abox.ex*.class: individual abox.label: \"___________________________________________________________________________\" abox: { \"ex:process parent\" -> \"ex:process step1\": \"ro:starts_with\" \"ex:process parent\" -> \"ex:process step3\": \"ro:ends_with\" \"ex:process parent\" -> \"ex:process step1\": \"ro:has part\" \"ex:process parent\" -> \"ex:process step2a\": \"ro:has part\" \"ex:process parent\" -> \"ex:process step2b\": \"ro:has part\" \"ex:process parent\" -> \"ex:process step3\": \"ro:has part\" \"ex:process step1\" -> \"ex:process step2a\": \"bfo:precedes\" \"ex:process step1\" -> \"ex:process step2b\": \"bfo:precedes\" \"ex:process step1\" -> \"ex:process step3\": \"bfo:precedes\" \"ex:process step2a\" -> \"ex:process step3\": \"bfo:precedes\" \"ex:process step2a\" -> \"ex:process step2b\": \"ro:simultaneous_with\" } abox.style.stroke: transparent abox.style.fill: transparent abox.\"ex:process parent\" -> tbox.\"bfo:process\": \"rdf:type\" abox.\"ex:process step1\" -> tbox.\"bfo:process\": \"rdf:type\" abox.\"ex:process step2a\" -> tbox.\"bfo:process\": \"rdf:type\" abox.\"ex:process step2b\" -> tbox.\"bfo:process\": \"rdf:type\" abox.\"ex:process step3\" -> tbox.\"bfo:process\": \"rdf:type\" @prefix : <https://w3id.org/pmd/co/test#> . @prefix ex: <https://www.example.org/> . @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> . @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> . @prefix xml: <http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace> . @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> . @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> . @base <https://w3id.org/pmd/co/test#> . @prefix process: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000015> . #Class @prefix has_part: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051> . #ObjectProperty @prefix precedes: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000063> . #ObjectProperty @prefix starts_with: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002224> . #ObjectProperty @prefix ends_with: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002230> . #ObjectProperty @prefix simultaneous_with: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002082> . #ObjectProperty <https://w3id.org/pmd/co/test/shape/process_chain> rdf:type owl:Ontology . ex:process_parent a process: . ex:process_step1 a process: . ex:process_step2a a process: . ex:process_step2b a process: . ex:process_step3 a process: . ex:process_parent starts_with: ex:process_step1 . ex:process_parent ends_with: ex:process_step3 . ex:process_parent has_part: ex:process_step1, ex:process_step2a, ex:process_step2b, ex:process_step3 . ex:process_step1 precedes: ex:process_step2a, ex:process_step2b, ex:process_step3 . ex:process_step2a precedes: ex:process_step3 . ex:process_step2a simultaneous_with: ex:process_step2b .", "keywords": "BFO BFO_0000015 BFO_0000051 BFO_0000063 Chain Graphviz_renderer_full OWL ObjectProperty PMD Pattern Process RDF RO_0002082 RO_0002224 RO_0002230 TTL XML XMLSchema ___________________________________________________________________________ bfo:occurrent bfo:precedes bfo:process class ends_with ex:process ex:process_parent graph has_part individual main material materialdigital namespace object obo ontology owl owl:Ontology pattern patterns pmd prefix process process_chain process_parent process_step1 process_step2a process_step2b process_step3 property rdf:type rdfs:subClassOf refs relation ro:ends_with ro:has ro:simultaneous_with ro:starts_with shape simultaneous_with starts_with subclass test tree turtle workflow"}, {"text": "Pattern 4 - Process Inputs and Outputs", "slug": "pattern-4-process-inputs-and-outputs", "level": 2, "content": "- Purpose: Describes how to represent inputs and outputs for planned processes typically involving material entities or information-bearing entities. - Description: A planned process with possibility of multiple inputs and outputs, e.g., testing properties of a metallic sample, or transforming a piece of material into another product. - Further notes: There are also the properties has input http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO0002233 and has output http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO0002234 from RO.

Behavioral material properties and processes: These represent how a material behaves under certain conditions. - A steel material has a melting point (1500 °C), which is realized through a melting process. - The melting process is triggered by an application of heat flux and involves a change of temperature as the material responds. 3. Relational material qualities: These capture qualities that depend on relations between materials and objects. - A mass proportion is expressed between some portion of iron and the metal sheet, with a value of 97.7 %. ```turtle @prefix : . @prefix ex: . @prefix owl: . @prefix rdf: . @prefix xml: . @prefix xsd: . @prefix rdfs: . @base . rdf:type owl:Ontology .", "keywords": "(Qualities) Graphviz_renderer_file Material OWL PMD Pattern Properties RDF TTL XML XMLSchema graph individual main material materialdigital namespace object ontology owl owl:Ontology pattern pmd prefix process property qualities_and_properties rdf:type refs relation semantic shape test turtle value"}, {"text": "Define prefixes ###", "slug": "define-prefixes", "level": 3, "content": "", "keywords": "### Define prefixes"}, {"text": "Classes", "slug": "classes", "level": 1, "content": "@prefix entity: . @prefix independentcontinuant: . @prefix materialentity: . @prefix object: . @prefix temporallyqualifiedcontinuant: . @prefix portionofiron: . @prefix material: . @prefix temporalregion: . @prefix quality: . @prefix mass: . @prefix density: . @prefix behavioralmaterialproperty: . @prefix specificallydependentcontinuant: . @prefix meltingpoint: . @prefix relationalquality: . @prefix massproportion: . @prefix scalarvaluespecification: . @prefix fractionvaluespecification: . @prefix gram: . @prefix grampercubiccentimetre: . @prefix degreecelsius: . @prefix masspercentage: . @prefix meltingprocess: . @prefix applicationofheatflux: . @prefix stimulatingprocess: . @prefix process: . @prefix changeoftemperature: .", "keywords": "BFO BFO_0000001 BFO_0000004 BFO_0000008 BFO_0000015 BFO_0000019 BFO_0000020 BFO_0000030 BFO_0000040 BFO_0000145 Classes OBI_0001931 PMD PMD_0000000 PMD_0000005 PMD_0000053 PMD_0000068 PMD_0000520 PMD_0000549 PMD_0000597 PMD_0000851 PMD_0000950 PMD_0020026 PMD_0020102 PMD_0020133 PMD_0025997 UO_0000021 UO_0000027 UO_0000084 UO_0000163 application_of_heat_flux behavioral_material_property change_of_temperature degree_celsius entity fraction_value_specification gram_per_cubic_centimetre independent_continuant mass_percentage mass_proportion material material_entity melting_point melting_process object obo pmd portion_of_iron prefix process property relation relational_quality scalar_value_specification specifically_dependent_continuant stimulating_process temporal_region temporally_qualified_continuant value"}, {"text": "Object properties", "slug": "object-properties", "level": 1, "content": "@prefix existsat: . @prefix isstateof: . @prefix qualityof: . @prefix characteristicof: . @prefix relationalqualityof: . @prefix hasspecifiednumericvalue: . @prefix hasmeasurementunitlabel: . @prefix specifiesvalueof: . @prefix hasrealization: . @prefix participatesin: . @prefix hasparticipant: . @prefix stimulatedby: . @prefix respondswith: . @prefix hasspecifiedinput: . @prefix hasspecifiedoutput: . @prefix specifiedbyvalue: .", "keywords": "BFO BFO_0000054 BFO_0000108 IAO_0000039 OBI_0000293 OBI_0000299 OBI_0001927 OBI_0001937 Object PMD PMD_0000070 PMD_0000077 PMD_0001029 PMD_0025999 RO_0000052 RO_0000056 RO_0000057 RO_0000080 characteristic_of exists_at has_measurement_unit_label has_participant has_realization has_specified_input has_specified_numeric_value has_specified_output is_state_of measurement obo participates_in pmd prefix properties quality_of relation relational_quality_of responds_with specified_by_value specifies_value_of stimulated_by unit value"}, {"text": "Instances ###", "slug": "instances", "level": 3, "content": "", "keywords": "### Instances"}, {"text": "Quality example", "slug": "quality-example", "level": 1, "content": "ex:metalsheet a object: . ex:massmetalsheet a mass: ;

Due to our ontological commitment to BFO, roles (like described in the patterns above) can only inhere in independent continuants, because a role is something that is physically realized when its bearer participates in a process. Information Content Entities (ICEs), such as datasets, specifications, or parameter files used in a simulation are generically dependent continuants. They are abstract contents that rely on some physical carrier (e.g., a hard drive) but do not themselves participate physically in a process. Assigning roles directly to ICEs would require the role to inhere in the ICE rather than in a material entity, which violates BFO's ontological constraints. To preserve the functionality of roles for informational inputs and outputs, we introduce process boundaries as \"input/output assignments\". In this pattern, an ICE participates in an input (or output) assignment, which is a dependent entity representing the assignment of that ICE to the process. The assignment itself is then part of the main process. This allows us to capture the role-like semantics of inputs and outputs without violating BFO's constraint that roles must inhere in material entities. Each assignment can be typed to specify its intended function in the process, while maintaining ontological consistency. For example, in a division calculation process, two numbers considered as ICE serve as inputs through role-like assignments: one as the numerator, and the other as the denominator. Each number participates in an input assignment that is part of the division process, while the resulting quotient participates in an output assignment. This pattern captures the functional roles of inputs and outputs without requiring the numbers themselves to bear roles directly, maintaining ontological consistency. ```turtle @prefix : . @prefix rdf: . @prefix rdfs: . @prefix owl: . @prefix xsd: . @prefix hasParticipant: . @prefix partOf: . @prefix InformationContentEntity: . @prefix SimulationProcess: . @prefix InputAssignment: . @prefix OutputAssignment: . @prefix hasSpecifiedValue: . @prefix isSpecifiedInputOf: . @prefix isSpecifiedOutputOf: . @prefix realizes: . ############################", "keywords": "BFO BFO_0000050 BFO_0000055 Graphviz_renderer_full IAO_0000030 ICE IRI InformationContentEntity InputAssignment OBI_0000295 OBI_0000312 OBI_0001937 OWL OutputAssignment PMD PMD_0000066 PMD_0000067 PMD_0000933 Pattern RDF RO_0000057 Simulation SimulationProcess TTL XMLSchema constraint dataset division entity graph input/output main material materialdigital obo ontology owl parameter pattern pmd prefix process refs semantic shape turtle value"}, {"text": "CLASS AXIOMS", "slug": "class-axioms", "level": 1, "content": "############################ :Number rdfs:subClassOf InformationContentEntity: . :DivisionProcess rdfs:subClassOf SimulationProcess: . :NumeratorAssignment rdfs:subClassOf InputAssignment: , rdf:type owl:Restriction ;

Simply create your repository following the instructions mentioned in “application-ontology-template” https://github.com/materialdigital/application-ontology-template. This template applies the same framework used for PMDco and mirrors PMDco with all its modules. 4- Collaborative ontology development workflow - Any person who wants to contribute to the collaborative development of ontology should clone the ODK repository to the local machine, - In Protégé, open the editable file: src/ontology/-edit.owl (Any editor can manage an assigned ID range), - Edit the ontology, like add classes/properties, update definitions, and organize axioms, - Save and validate locally, - Commit your edits and push them to your branch, - Create a Pull Request, submit a PR with a short summary and justification of your changes, - Team members review; after approval, the PR is merged. 5- Add your desired taxonomy - Edit ontology in protégé, - Create new classes, properties, and individuals according to your terminology lists, - Structure them hierarchically in alignment with reused top- and mid-level ontologies, where subclasses inherit properties from their superclasses, - Evaluate other OBO Foundry ontologies (e.g., using Ontobee https://ontobee.org/) to check for existing classes and to guide your classification. In the case you want to import entities from other ontologies, please follow the instructions here https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/update-import/, - Following OBO principles https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-007-relations.html, build the ontology primarily by extending the class hierarchy and minimizing the introduction of new object properties. - Add rich annotations for new entities (such as definitions, references, examples, and editorial notes). - Include comprehensive ontology annotation metadata (e.g., title, label, description, creators, contributors, version info, previous versions, license, and citation). 6- Define a richer semantic model with multiple relationship types, rules, and constraints - Define logical axioms and property constraints (e.g., domain and range), - Use graphical tools (e.g., Ontopanel or Miro) to visually discuss the modeling issues, - Use our Ontology Design Patterns https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main/patterns as a guideline for the semantic representation of your concepts, - See other PMDco-based application ontologies (listed below this page) for similar modeling concepts. - If you still need support for specific modelling issues, please feel free to mention it in our GitHub issues https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/mwo/issues or discussion forum https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/discussions. 7- Ontology evaluation and testing workflow - Plan regular meetings with both ontology and MSE domain experts in your project to assess the ontology’s structure, resolve modeling issues, and ensure its logical correctness, - Use ODK evaluation and testing workflows through GitHub Actions Continuous Integration to validate the ontology’s structure, syntax, annotation completeness, and logical consistency, - Use reasoning tools (e.g., reasoners HermiT and Pellet) to ensure logical and technical consistency and identify potential redundancies, - Analyzes the ontology for common modeling pitfalls, structural issues, and best-practice violations using tools like OOPS! (Ontology Pitfall Scanner!), - We will be pleased to invite you to present your ontology in one of our “Ontology Playground meetings” (See Section Who We Are & How to Join) 8- Ontology release, updating, and versioning workflow - Use ODK automated workflow for the release process, which follows these steps: running the release with ODK, reviewing the output, merging changes into the main branch, and creating a GitHub release. - Track actively the GitHub issue to gather community feedback, recognize bugs, and identify necessary additions and refinements. - Implement a curation process to assess and prioritize updates based on community needs. - Employ the robust versioning system hosted on GitHub to ensure clear tracking of changes over time, management of previous versions, and clear tracking of the ontology’s evolution over time. 9- Ontology documentation and publishing - Create detailed documentation, including best practices, examples, and guidelines in your ontology GitHub repository. - Use Widoco template https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco, a documentation generator for ontologies that automatically produces human-readable HTML documentation including metadata, hierarchies of classes, properties, and annotations, - If you are using “application-ontology-template” https://github.com/materialdigital/application-ontology-template, your ontology is automatically documented in obofoundary.org https://obofoundry.org/, - To enhance your ontology accessibility, please also publish your ontology in MatPortal https://matportal.org/ and PMD DataPortal https://dataportal.material-digital.de/.

The reused ontologies listed below: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) Based on OBO Foundry principles https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html, BFO has served as a formal top-level ontology since its introduction in 2002. Its latest release, BFO 2020 https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020, provides a domain-neutral framework for consistent ontology development and forms the basis of the ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html standard for semantic interoperability. BFO is widely recognized as a preferred top-level ontology for building domain ontologies due to its philosophically grounded and logically rigorous foundations. Its domain-neutral nature, robust theoretical underpinnings, and modular, hierarchically structured design promote clarity, consistency, extensibility, and long-term maintainability. BFO also supports formal reasoning, enabling automated reasoning tools to validate logical coherence and uncover new insights, making it an effective framework for developing interoperable and semantically precise ontologies across diverse scientific and technical domains. BFO offers a systematic framework for categorizing entities based on their core characteristics and relationships, providing consistency in data classification and interoperability. It provides a formal, top-level hierarchy consisting of 36 classes, that categorizes all entities into two primary branches: “continuants” and “occurrents”. “Occurrents” are entities that unfold or happen over time, such as “processes” (e.g., a heating experiment) and “temporal regions” (e.g., time intervals in which processes occur). In contrast, “continuants” persist through time while possibly undergoing change, and further divided into independent and dependent continuants. “Independent continuants” include “material entities” (e.g., specimens, instruments) and “immaterial entities” (e.g., surfaces, boundaries) that exist on their own. “Specifically dependent continuants” depend on particular bearers and include “qualities” (e.g., mass, temperature) and “realizable entities” (e.g., roles, dispositions, and functions) that can be manifested under certain conditions. “Generally dependent continuants” depend on other entities but can exist across multiple bearers; typical examples are digital files or textual content. As the backbone of PMDco development, we selected BFO over alternative top-level ontologies because it provides a philosophically grounded, domain-neutral framework with a clear continuant–occurrent distinction, ensuring semantic coherence, interoperability, and long-term stability for building extensible ontologies in MSE. To date, numerous well-established ontologies have been developed based on BFO across diverse domains, demonstrating its broad applicability and compatibility. Building ontologies based on BFO ensures seamless integration with other BFO-aligned resources, enhancing interoperability, reusability, and scalability. This foundation supports interdisciplinary collaboration and fosters the development of robust semantic frameworks for diverse research and application contexts. Relation Ontology (RO) The Relation Ontology (RO) https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/, also known as the OBO Relation Ontology, is a structured collection of formally defined relationships used to standardize how entities are connected across biological and biomedical ontologies. Developed within the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry, it provides a shared vocabulary of relational types such as “part of”, “develops from”, or “located in”, which allow consistent representation of spatial, temporal, and functional associations between biological entities. RO serves as a foundation for interoperability and logical reasoning across diverse domains, including anatomy, ecology, and neuroscience, by defining and organizing these relations in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format. Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) The Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO is a domain-neutral ontology designed to represent and classify information entities, such as documents, datasets, images, and digital records. Developed within the OBO Foundry framework, IAO defines the concept of an “information content entity” (ICE) to describe any item that conveys information about some aspect of reality. Its goal is to support the consistent annotation, integration, and analysis of data across fields like biomedicine, informatics, and philosophy of information. Rooted in ontological realism, IAO formalizes how information artifacts relate to what they represent and the media through which they are expressed, enabling interoperability among diverse knowledge systems. Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) The Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/ ontology is a freely available, well-structured classification of molecular entities focused on “small” chemical compounds of biological relevance. Developed by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) as part of the OBO Foundry, ChEBI defines molecular entities as any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, radical, complex, or conformer that can exist independently. It provides an ontological framework to describe relationships between these molecular entities and their classes, supporting consistent naming, annotation, and data integration in chemistry and biology. ChEBI follows internationally accepted standards from IUPAC and NC-IUBMB and explicitly excludes genome-encoded macromolecules like nucleic acids and proteins. Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) https://obi-ontology.org/ is a comprehensive ontology developed within the OBO Foundry to provide a standardized representation of all aspects of biological and clinical investigations. It defines thousands of precisely characterized terms describing processes such as experimental design, instrumentation, materials used, data generated, and analytical methods, ensuring consistent annotation and interoperability across diverse scientific domains. OBI integrates and reuses parts of other biomedical ontologies like the Gene Ontology (GO) and ChEBI while maintaining logical consistency and semantic clarity. By modeling the full investigative process (planning, execution, and reporting) OBI enables more effective data sharing, integration, and semantic reasoning in biomedical research.", "keywords": "BFO Document_indicator EBI EMBL GO IAO ICE IEC ISO IUBMB IUPAC MSE NC OBI OBO OWL Ontologies PMD PMDco RO Reused URI analysis annotation chebi class dataset domain edge entity experiment hierarchy material oborel ontology principles process reasoning relation semantic specimen standard", "terms": "about accepted acids across aligned all allow also alternative among analysis analytical anatomy and annotation any applicability application are artifact artifacts aspect aspects associations atom automated available backbone based basic basis bearers because been below between bfo bioinformatics biological biology biomedical biomedicine boundaries branches broad building but can categorizes categorizing certain change characteristics characterized chebi chemical chemistry clarity classes classification classify clear clinical coherence collaboration collection com compatibility complements complex compounds comprehensive concept conditions conformer connected consistency consistent consisting constitutionally content contexts continuant continuants contrast conveys core data datasets date defined defines defining demonstrating depend dependent describe describing design designed developed developing development develops digital dispositions distinct distinction diverse divided documents domain domains due ebi ecology effective embl enables enabling encoded enhancing ensures ensuring entities entity established european examples excludes execution exist existing experiment experimental explicitly expressed extends extensibility extensible fields files focused follows for formal formalizes formally format forms fosters foundation foundations foundry framework frameworks freely from full functional functions further gene generally generated genome github goal grounded happen has have heating hierarchically hierarchy how html https iao ice iec images immaterial include including independent independently informatics information insights institute instrumentation instruments integrates integration interdisciplinary interest internationally interoperability interoperable intervals into introduction investigations investigative ion iso isotopically item its iubmb iupac knowledge known language latest level like listed located logical logically long macromolecules maintainability maintaining making manifested mass material materials media methods mid modeling modular molecular molecule more mse multiple naming nature neuroscience neutral new nucleic numerous obi obo obofoundry oborel occur occurrent occurrents offers ontological ontologies ontology open org organizing other over owl own part particular parts persist philosophically philosophy planning pmdco possibly precise precisely preferred primary principles process processes promote proteins provide provides providing qualities radical realism reality realizable reasoning recognized records regions relate relation relational relations relationships release relevance reporting represent representation research resources reusability reused reuses rigorous robust roles rooted scalability scientific seamless selected semantic semantically served serves several shared sharing since small some spatial specifically specimens stability standard standardize standardized standards structured such summary support supporting supports surfaces systematic systems tailored technical temperature temporal term terms textual that the their theoretical these they this thousands through time tools top two types typical uncover under undergoing underpinnings unfold used validate vocabulary web well what which while widely with within www", "headings": [{"text": "Reused Ontologies", "slug": "reused-ontologies", "level": 1, "content": "The PMDco complements and extends several existing ontologies by providing a mid-level framework tailored for the MSE domain.

The safest approach is to relocate each major conceptual block of the old ontology into the appropriate BFO branch and then check whether PMDco 3.x already provides an equivalent class or modeling pattern. Before you start: Familiarize yourself with the BFO class hierarchy (PMDco 3.x is built on top of it). (PMDco is using the atemporal variant of BFO 2020 https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/tree/master/21838-2/owl/profiles/atemporal. This variant does not include the BFO2020 temporalized relations.) Consult the BFO classifier (link https://keet.wordpress.com/2023/06/29/improved-the-bfo-classifier/). Review the PROV–BFO mapping (link https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04580-1). Understand the most relevant imported ontologies: RO (Relation Ontology) https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html, IAO (Information Artifact Ontology) https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO/. Migration Guidelines 1. prov:Activity based classes → bfo:process In PMDco 2.0.8, many classes modeled under prov:Activity represent processes, workflows, computational steps, material operations, or data transformations. In BFO, all such happenings belong under bfo:process. Move these classes into the bfo:process / bfo:occurrent branch. Anything that “unfolds”, “occurs”, or “executes” in time should be treated as a process. 2. prov:Agents (humans, organizations) → bfo:independent continuants Agents are no longer modeled as activity performers (as in PROV-O). In PMDco 3.x they become bfo:independent continuants : Human agents → subclass of Homo sapiens (NCBITaxon_9606), under bfo:material entity . Organizations → subclass of obi:organization , under bfo:material entity . Exception: Software agents are not bfo:independent continuants ; they are information artifacts and should be modeled as subclasses of iao:information content entity (below bfo:generically dependent continuant ). 3. Objects, Samples, Devices → bfo:independent continuants (bfo:material entities) Any entity with physical existence — devices, instruments, materials, equipment, objects — belongs to the bfo:material entity branch. Place each of those under the most specific material entity class available in PMDco 3.x. Review object-related properties, since physical entities typically carry qualities, roles, realizable entities which may need adjustment during migration (see ValueObjects below). 4. ValueScope, DigitalEntity, and data-like conceptual classes → iao:information content entities (ICE) PMDco 3.0 consolidates informational and conceptual constructs under the iao:information content entities (ICE) hierarchy. Classes such as ValueScope, DigitalEntity, and general metadata belong here. Anything that describes or represents information about something (instead of being the thing itself) is an iao:information content entity . 5. ValueObjects → split across bfo:qualities, bfo:realizable entities, and ICE This is one of the most significant conceptual changes. Many ValueObject classes in 2.0.8 combine: - qualities (mass, color, resolution, etc.), - realizable entities (roles, functions, capabilities, etc.), - information content (identifiers, names, codes, descriptions, specifications, etc.). In BFO, these must be separated. Guidelines: If the ValueObject describes an inherent property of an entity → classify under bfo:quality or pmd:behavioral material property (e.g., size, precision, temperature range). If it describes a capability, role, or function → classify under bfo:disposition , bfo:function , bfo:role . If it represents data, codes, or symbolic values → classify under iao:information content entity . A single old class may need to be split into two or three new ones. PMDco 3.x with BFO enforces distinctions that PROV-O did not. 6. Relation Migration (common replacements) subordinate process → bfo:has part previous process → bfo:preceded by has characteristic → select one of ro:characteristic of subproperty ( ro:has role , ro:has quality , ro:has function , ro:has disposition ) composed of → bfo:has part component → bfo: has part executes → ro:participates in (do not confuse with stato:executes ) has role → bfo:has role * relates to → often replaced by iao:is about (if the subject is an ICE) -- These recommendations are not exhaustive, and some cases will not have a clean one-to-one transformation.

Its primary mission is to establish a virtual materials data space that systematizes the handling of hierarchical, process-dependent materials data while ensuring semantic interoperability across decentralized and diverse servers. Rather than acting as a direct service provider, PMD focuses on developing prototype infrastructures and tool solutions to drive the digital transformation in materials science and engineering. It serves as a networking hub and communication interface (organizing webinars, events, and outreach activities) to connect stakeholders and foster collaboration between academic and industrial partners, ultimately strengthening Germany’s international competitiveness in materials digitalization. Semantic interoperability working group The Semantic Interoperability Team https://www.materialdigital.de/ontologies/ within the Platform MaterialDigital (PMD) plays a key role in ensuring standardized, cross-domain data integration and communication across materials science initiatives. As the platform’s primary semantic backbone, the team is responsible for the development and maintenance of PMDco, the core ontology of PMD. Their work focuses on creating and sustaining frameworks that represent materials data in a consistent and meaningful way, enabling experimental, simulation, and characterization data to be linked, interpreted, and reused without ambiguity. To achieve this, they collaborate closely with ontology experts and materials science specialists to harmonize data models, establish metadata standards, and embed FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles throughout the PMD infrastructure. In addition, the team facilitates active knowledge exchange across the consortium by managing open communication channels and community forums. These spaces allow members to share expertise, address modeling challenges, and propose improvements, ensuring that the platform continuously evolves in response to emerging needs and technological advancements.
