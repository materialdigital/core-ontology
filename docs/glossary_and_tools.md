# Glossary and Tools

## Glossary

- [MaterialDigital Initiative Glossary](https://material-digital.de/glossar/) - a comprehensive glossary for the ontology-related terms. English and German versions available. 

## Tools and Resources

### Tutorials and Interesting Facts

This section comprises links and information on onboardings with respect to semantic interoperability, relevant Youtoube channels, and other initiatives being active in the field.

#### Ontology Development Guide

In cooperation with participants in the ([MaterialDigital initiative](https://www.materialdigital.de/)), a guide for the development of ontologies in general was created, which contains basic aspects and recommended procedures. This guide may be expanded and developed further and is hosted at the The Scientific Ontology Network.

### Tools for Ontology Development and Maintenance

* [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/software.php) - Software used for ontology development and maintenance.
* [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) - Online tool for visual diagrams construction.
* [OntoPanel](https://yuechenbam.github.io/src/main/webapp/index.html) - A tool for ontology creation, including the Draw.io plugin
* [Chowlk Converter](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/) - Chowlk Converter is a web application that takes as input an ontology conceptualization made with diagrams.net and generates its implementation in OWL.
* [OTTR](https://ottr.xyz/) - language with supporting tools for representing and instantiating RDF graph and OWL ontology modelling patterns. Provides an abstraction level on top of basic RDF functionality.
* [OOPS!](https://oops.linkeddata.es/) - OOPS! is a web-based tool, independent of any ontology development environment, for detecting potential pitfalls that could lead to modelling errors.
    * [Scientific Paper Publication on OOPS!](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj989.pdf) (open access)
* [RDF Grapher](https://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher) - RDF grapher is a web service for parsing RDF data and visualizing it as a graph.
* [OnToology](http://ontoology.linkeddata.es/) - A system to automate part of the collaborative ontology development process. Given a repository with an owl file, OnToology will survey it and produce diagrams, a complete documentation and validation based on common pitfalls. 
* [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) - ROBOT is a tool for working with Open Biomedical Ontologies. It can be used as a command-line tool or as a library for any language on the Java Virtual Machine.
    * [Scientific Paper Publication on ROBOT](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1186/s12859-019-3002-3?author_access_token=bB8BLjFWrdh42vR6DjT-nG_BpE1tBhCbnbw3BuzI2RPCZ2BK7EeexaCNYfT-cCz8Q_mrZomT2_svoQf12CW661Sagzw6JGF9DhJq3Q3fTPdMGFMtais7MRgx8-kDhp6uC9g2qcVh5FumTsveV22XVQ%3D%3D) (open access)
